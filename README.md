# QuasyCode
small kOS Theme, don't use on other languages...

Once installed, make sure it's open in WINRAR (or your alternative)
Then go to (*USERNAME*/.VSCODE/Extensions) and then make a folder named "Quasy.Code-cd" and place the files inside.
Open VSCODE, go to the settings cog (bottom left) and select the colour theme, now look for Quasy.Code, Thanks.
